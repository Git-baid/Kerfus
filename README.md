![Kerfur meow]()

Inspired by [Kerfur Omega](https://voicesofthevoid.wiki.gg/wiki/Kerfur-Omega) from [Voices of the Void](https://mrdrnose.itch.io/votv) (Which was inspired by the Polish robot [Kerfus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerfu%C5%9B))

This bot serves as a central hub for integrating and controlling all my smart devices I plan to build.

[Voice recognition software](https://voiceattack.com/) recognizes commands I say and will execute scripts on my computer to send to Kerfur
- "Kerfur, turn the lights on"
